        Hello DBC! Welcome to my homepage
   </div>
   <p class="body"> This is my home-index, where you can navigate to everything my site has to offer including my cultural and technical blog posts, as well as projects and assignments I complete (once that happens). I will continue to add content as it becomes available. Please feel free to give me feed back via any of my social media accounts, or preferably email. I hope you enjoy my site!
    <p id="professionalBlog">I am currently in the process of ulitlizing javascript and jquery to make dynamic drop down menus. Once I have these implemented navigation throughout the site will be much easier. It has taken me longer than I originally thought to get it right but I expect to have it done soon. Writing the javascript itself was very easy, it's the CSS that I'm still trying to work out.</p>
