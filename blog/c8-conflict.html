    <h1>Conflict </h1>
    <h3>Week 8</h3>
    <h3> April 17th, 2015</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="header">
      Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      My most recent source of conflict was actually over a review I recieved from one of the DBC instuctors concerning one of my weekly assignments. I normally wouldn't write about this sort of interaction but I think theres actually a lot to learn from the experience, and hopefully I can share that lesson.
    </p>
    <p id="header">
      What was the source of the conflict?
    </p>
     <p>
        At the source of the conflict was the fact that I did not understand what it  actually was that the instructor said my work was lacking. The terms used in the review iteslf seemed subjective to me, and open to interpretation. It was for that reason that I decided to email the instructer to clarify the points they were making.
     </p>
     <p id="header">
        What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
     </p>
     <p>
        At the time I felt very frustrated and disappointed in myself for not producing a solution that was deemed on track with the course expectations of that week. This in turn made me feel very defensive about the code in my solution, and I think in some way my mind was trying to justify my work by putting blame in the instructor for not looking over the entire solution. When I re-read the instructers email, I felt that they were being short with me and not giving my work due attention. Of course by this point I wasn't making very objective assesments of the situation and felt that offended that the instructor hadn't spent enough time to give me a proper review. I also felt a bit of panic considering that not meeting the weeks expectations were grounds for recieving a yellow flag.
     </p>
     <p id="header">
        What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
     </p>
     <p>
        I promptly emailed the DBC staff (I mistakenly did this since I thought I was only emailing the instructor) asking the instructor to explain how they came to their conclusions as well as asking what exactly the instructor meant by certain terms used in the review. At the time in my mind I thought that if I just got the answers to those questions as soon as possible all would be well and that I could just avoid making whatever mistakes I had made in the future.
      </p>

        If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
What did you learn from this experience?
    </p>
    <p>
        The email that I sent to the DBC staff was written in a very defensive manner, and if I had taken sometime to cool off and re-read it before sending it I think I would have seen this. For that reason my questions came off soley as a self-defense. This is not at all what I intended and I did not effectively communicate the issues I had or what it was that I wanted to know. If I had taken the time to carefully word my response and not just fire-back an email that on face value appeared to question the validity of the review itself I would have been much better off. Despite the the angry sounding email, one of the staff gave me very insightfull answers to some of my questions, but also cautioned against associating critiques on my code as critiques on me. In short don't send people emails when you're feeling frustrated or angry. Wait a bit, break down your points or issues into concise statements that don't have any sort of tone to them.
