    <h1>Challenges of Pairing and Feedback </h1>
    <h3>Week 5</h3>
    <h3> March 29th, 2015</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      Throughout these past 5 weeks in the DBC I've had a good number of parring sessions and I've found that it isn't quite as simple as it seems when you first read about parring and how to go about it in the phase-0 handbook. Every experience I've had so far was a positive one, that I felt I was able to take away and learn something from. However, each experience has been different, and there were a few where I found myself getting a little annoyed. I realize that it's only natural for this to happen, since each of us is a human being with feelings. Most of the time the strongest feelings that my paring sessions have evoked were excitement, frustration, curiousity. Those few times that I found myself getting annoyed with the person I was working with arose when I felt that they weren't giving me a chance to speak. In those instances it seemed to me that the person did not have the patience to give me a chance to explain my thoughts or to check and see if I had an answer or approach to the task at hand. I believe those situations arise when a person who knows or feels like they have all the answers or solutions to the obstacles in front of them, they get anxious to move on and have a tendency to be short with whoever they're working with. I think it also results from situations where one person precieves the other as steering off into the wrong direction and often jumps in to correct them. I think the answer to avoiding this conflict, even when the experience and knowledge of the pair is very unequal, is to always allow a person to speak and to fully hear them out before offering a solution of your own. I'm pretty sure I've done this a few times myself, so I don't fault anyone who does this at this point, and right now I'm doing my best to work on it.

    <p> Feedback is very important in any team enviorment as well as solo enviorments. Feedback allows you to assess your strengths and weaknesses so that you can work on improving your performance. Therefore it is crucial that the feedback given to a person be of a useful form that gives insight into what could be improved, how it could be improved and doing so in a way that doesn't raise the recievers emotional defenses. I feel that kind feedback is feedback that is done respectfully without insulting the person as well as being completely honest. Being kind to a person doesn't necessarily mean giving them compliments, I think it also includes being able to tell a person what they need to hear. Sometimes this can be the most difficult thing for both the reciever and the giver, but it's very important that the person knows what they need to improve on. In short I think kind feedback is respectful yet critical and honest.

    <p>
      I think specific feedback is pretty straight forward, it means giving meaning and context to whatever feedback is given. Specific feedback would usually entail an example or two to clairify or justify whatever statment is given. Specific feedback shouldn't include any generalizing or vague statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actionable feedback should always pertain to an aspect of a person and their tendencies that they can actually improve on. Telling a person that their voice is really annoying is not constructive in anyway since they can't really change it. Actionable feedback should usually be something that can readily be improved upon with a solution offered. In this sense one would not only point out the problems that another person has, but provide them with things to do instead of or in place of the faulty actions.

    <p id="header"> Recieving Feedback </p>
    <p> I'm not going to lie, that I feel pretty nervous about reading or hearing what other people have to say about me. Whenever I read something about me that I don't like or entirely agree with, almost without fail, I hear that voice in my head offering a counter argument as to why that person is wrong. It's a bad self defence mechanism of mine that I need to work on letting go. I want my thoughts to be formed off of facts and not my emotional need to feel good at everything. I really do feel vulnerable whenever I'm being assessed and to a strong extent even when it's mostly good things that are being said. I'm not sure why I feel that way, but this hasn't been an easy thing for me to address or work on. Telling myself it's fine to have certain aspects of my performance judged objectively by another person is not the same thing as feeling it. I believe these feelings in me arise because I take everything to personally. I need to remind myself that these assessments are meant to help me and that they are not jabs at me as a person. Whenever I'm paring with someone, I usually try to go in with as much relevant knowledge as I can before hand that way I can maximize productivity on my end, but also so that the person I'm working with doesn't view me as unintelligent or prepared. I'm actually pretty nervous about dragging my pairing partner down and I don't want to feel intimidated by them either.

      Overall I feel that pairing is the best way to when it comes to coding. I find that the generation of ideas comes so much more quickly with spoken dialog and the creativity of having two people together is greater than the sum of the each individuals creativity. It's also fantastic to have another person watching your work for small mistakes and typos. I think my feedback has been pretty helpful, it's given me a gauge to work off of concerning what I need to improve or tone down. DBC has provided a useful format and criteria for giving feed back where the catagories of the scores you recieve actually say a lot that's not directly said by the person in the written assessment of you. When you recieve a low score in something such as benefit of technical knowledge, its not them telling you directly that you're stupid but that relative to them you didn't have much to pass on. This then tells you that you have plenty of room for improvement, specifically in focusing on learning more about whatever topic you're covering that week. Just knowing that someone else knows more than you can give you motivation to learn more.

      Recieving the feedback wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. I felt nervous reading through them but ultimately realized that it was actually pretty useful. I haven't actually recieved anything that made a strong remark about something I could improve upon, or an issue that I have so I can't really say how I'll react to it later on down the line when I do. I've found that when I am giving others feedback, it's actually pretty hard to give specific advice. I usually will sit there for about five minutes trying to recall things that the person may have done or said that I could actually critique and doesn't always come to me. I need to focus a little more on the interactions I have with people rather then only on the task at hand. Also sometimes I feel bad about saying things that I mean in the most sincere way but I can easily see the person precieving it as an attack on them personally so I try really hard to word in such a way that doesn't evoke those feelings. But just in general I feel kind of bad whenever I'm giving out score to someone that are less than perfect.
