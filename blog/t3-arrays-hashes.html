  <h2>Week 3: Arrays & Hashes </h2>
  <h3>Skipper's log 3/14/2015:</h3>

  <p>
    Happy pie day! Today at 9:26 (am & pm) and 53 seconds we have the first 10 digits of pie in sequential order: 3/14/15 9:26:53 or 3.141592653. This only happens once in a century!
  </p>
  <p>
    Today's topic covers the usage of arrays and hashes in Ruby. Both can be thought of as data containers used for storing useful information. Arrays are quite simple, and can be thought of as a connected sequential chain of boxes or containers that each hold a single value. Say we want to build an array containing the first 10 digits of the number pi, we would simply enter:
  </p>
  <code> pi = [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3] </code>
  <p>We can access any of those values by refering to the index of the value we want. An index value in the contet of an array is sort of like the address of where that value lives inside of the array. For example, the first value of an array lives at index value 0, and the last number of this array lives at index value 9. In the context of ruby code you would use the index address with this syntax: </p>
<div id="codeblock">
  <code> pi[0] = 3       # the first value in the array 'pi' is 3                           </code><br>
  <code> pi[1] = 1       # the second value in the array is 1, and lives at index address 1 </code><br>
  <code> pi[2] = 4       # the third value in the array is 4, and lives at index address 2  </code> <br>
  <code> pi[9] = 3       # the last value in the array is 3, and lives at index address 9, one less than 10 </code>
</div>
</span>
  <!--<details>
          <summary><code> pi[9] = 3       </code></summary>
          <p># the last value in the array is 3, and lives at index address 9, one less than 10</p>
  </details> -->

  <p>
    I'm sure you've noticed that indexs actually count up from 0 to the last index value of the array. So for our array that contanins 10 values we have the index numbers 0..9. The last index number will always be one less than the total length of the array and by length I mean the number of values wich the array holds.
  </p>
  <div id="codeblock">
    <code> array.length = number_of_values_the_array_holds </code> <br>
    <code> pi.length = 10 </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    In fact in many languages, it's a common practice to reference the end of the array when you're not sure how long it is by using an index value defined as the array's length minus one:
  </p>
  <code> last_value = pi[ (pi.length) -1] = pi[10 - 1] = 3 </code>
  <p> However, Ruby gives us an even better short hand way to reference the last value: </p>
  <code> last_value = pi[-1] = 3 </code>
  <p> Ruby will take the index value of '-1' to mean the last value of the array. The index value '-2' will refer to the second to the last value of the array and so forth all the way back to the front of the array where in our example, pi[-10] referes to the first value, 3.
  </p>
  <p> Ruby has many built in array methods to provide a versatile interface that allows you to do nearly any operation you can imagine on an array. For the purposes of this blog post we will stick to just the basics and only talk about different methods to add or remove values to or from an array. First off, any value of an array can be overwritten with the following syntax:
  </p>

  <div id="codeblock">
     <code> abc = ["a","b","c"] # defined simple array that holds 3 string values</code><br>
     <code> abc[2] = "d"        # changed the value at index 2 to "d"          </code>
  </div>
  <p> If you are not overwriting pre-existing values, then you are either adding values to the array or removing them. The methods unshift,shift, push and pop are the most commonly used. The method unshift will add or append a value to the front of the array, and it's counterpart, shift, will remove values from the front of the array. Like-wise, push will stick a value onto the end of the array and it's counterpart, pop, will remove a value from the end of the array. It's important to remember that the methods which remove elements from an array will output those removed values as a return value. Here's a diagram that you can use to easily remember and visualize these pairs:
  </p>
    <div class="array-methods"></div>

  </div>

  <div id="codeblock">
    <code> letters = ["a","b","c"] </code> <br>
    <code> letters.push("d") </code> <br>
    <code> => ["a","b","c","d"] </code> <br>
    <code> letters.unshift("A") </code> <br>
    <code> => ["A","a","b","c","d"] </code> <br>
    <code> letters.pop </code> <br>
    <code> => "d"   # pop's return value is "d" which it removed from the array</code> <br>
    <code> puts letters </code> <br>
    <code> => ["A","a","b","c"] </code> <br>
    <code> leters.shift </code> <br>
    <code> => "A"  # shift's return value is "A" which it removed from the array</code> <br>
    <code> puts letters </code> <br>
    <code> => ["a","b","c"] </code>
  </div>
    <p>That's it for array basics. The next topic is Hashes or Hash-tables. I would like to first talk about how to use hashes and then why they are useful and under what circumstances they are best used.
    </p>
    <p> Hashes are anothery type of data container that Ruby provides and have a similar structure to arrays except the indexs of hashes can take on the form of any ruby object as opposed to just integers. There are four ways to create a hash:
    </p>
    <div id="codeblock">
      <code> {} #(A) the literal constructor </code> <br>
      <code> Hash.new #(B) class method of class Hash </code> <br>
      <code> Hash.[] # (C)another class method of class Hash </code> <br>
      <code> Hash # (D) a top level method with the name hash </code>
    </div>

      <div id="codeblock">
        <code> a = {} #same as a = Hash.new, a = Hash.[], a = Hash[]</code> <br>
        <code> => {} </code> <br>
        <code> a = Hash </code> <br>
        <code> => Hash # the output is different from the rest, but a is still a hash </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        In choice (A), where we use the literal constuctor, we can assign what are called key-value pairs like so:
      </p>
      <code> a = {"one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3} </code>
      <p>
        These key-value pairs are the essence of what makes a hash a hash. When using this method of assignment, the key will always be on the left hand side of the arrow, and the value it corresponds to will always be on the left hand side. Once you have keys defined in the hash you can look up their values the same way you would in an array, you use their index address wich is exactly what the 'key' in key/value pair is.
      </p>
      <div id="codeblock">
        <code> test_number = a["one"] </code> <br>
        <code> => 1 # now the variable test_number = 1 </code> <br>
      </div>
      <p>
        If we use choice (C), we can define a hash using an array provided the array has an even number of elements.
      </p>
      <div id="codeblock">
        <code> favorite_colors = Hash["Billy","blue","Tess","teal","Randy","red"] </code> <br>
        <code> => {"Billy" => "teal", "Tess" => "teal", "Randy" => "red"} </code> <br>
        <code> favorite_numbers = Hash[ ["Billy",7], ["Tess",6], ["Randy",15.98]] </code> <br>
        <code> => {"Billy" => 7, "Tess" => 6, "Randy" => 15.98} </code>
      </div>

     <p>
      If we use choice (B) we can set default values to keys that have not been created yet.
      <div id="codeblock">
        <code> breakfast = Hash.new("biscuits") </code><br>
        <code> => {} </code> <br>
        <code> breakfast["Monday"] = "eggs toast"; breakfast["Tuesday"] = "bacon and toast" ; breakfast["Wednesday"] = "pancakes and toast" </code> <br>
        <code>puts breakfast["Friday"]  </code> <br>
        <code> => "biscuits" # Since we haven't defined what value the key "Friday" holds it will automatically be set to our default value </code>
      </div>
      <p>Consequently everyday in our example besides Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday will have a default value of "biscuits".
      </p>
      <p> Hashes also take symbols as keys which are easier to type out than strings. </p>
      <div id="codeblock">
        <code> prey[:snakes] = "puppies and kittens" </code> <br>
        <code> => {:snakes => "puppies and kittens"} </code> <br>
        <code> prey[:lions => "antelope", :crocodiles => "zebra"] </code> <br>
        <code> => {:snakes => "puppies and kittens", :lions => antelope", :crocodiles => "zebra"} </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        Hashes are very useful for storing large sets of data that have no numercial pattern associated with them. For example, if you stored a thousand different people's favorite colors in an array such as favorite_colors[n] ="Billy Joe, blue". Now say you want to find what color Jill Smith likes, you would literally have to iterate through each value in the array untill you found one who's string value contains "Jill Smith". You would have to write a bit of code that loops through each value in the array, and just wait for it to hit the right index value. Hashes, however, provide you with a quick look-up method, you simply get it from favorite_colors["Jill Smith"]. Hashes provide you with faster than linear search time.
