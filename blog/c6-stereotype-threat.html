    <h1>Stereotype Threat </h1>
    <h3>Week 6</h3>

      Many people of various social and racial groups are vulnerable to falling into the trap of self fulfilling prophecies. In short, if you believe that you're likely to be bad at something based on preconcieved notions of that certain types of people just aren't good at certain things, ultimately you will fulfil those expectations and perform worse, simply because you believed you would. The effects appear to be more pronounced with individuals who more strongly identify with the group being stereotyped.

      As a white male, I have a few stereotypes including poor math skills in comparison to asian people, poor athletic ablility in general, and a higher likelihood to being racist and or sexist. I haven't really thought much about these stereotypes lately, but I do remember back in grade school I certainly believed that I could never be "as good at sports" as other kids and ruled off the idea of ever becoming a professional player of any sport early on. I've also avoided dancing as much as possible all throughout highschool, college and even now. I also know that in college, most of my friends that I studied math with were asian. However, I'm not so sure if that is because of the stereotype or the fact that in Hawaii, most of the kids I went to college with and took classes with were asian. It's hard to say really how the stereotype threat has effected me beyond athletics.

      These concepts are new and yet familiar to me. I know that I've always held the notion that white people can't dance or play sports that well but I never really have thought about it in these terms before. I never thought that believeing these things would in turn affect my performance. I suppose overcoming these beliefs is going to be quite difficult since they are concepts I've self reinforced over the years. I think the most powerful thing I and any individual can do for themselves is to stop identifying with some label that somehow describes you as a person. I need to reflect on the concept that I am what I make myself, nothing more and nothing less.
