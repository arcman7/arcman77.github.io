  <h1>Chef vs. Kitchen Mentality</h1>
  <h3>Week 1</h3>
  <h3>March 1st, 2015:</h3>


    <p>
      My impression of DBC has more or less remained the same after watching one of the DBC culturual videos, although I do feel a tad bit more responsible for what I take away from all this. DevBootCamp is not a factory where they churn out junior software engineers on a cohort assembly line, it's more like a gym where people with the right self determination and willpower can turn themselves into buff web-app builders. It seems to me that all the tools and equipment are here for us to use, heck we even have personal trainers availible to us (at certain hours), and we have our classmates as eachothers spotters.

        I see myself doing well in this sort of culture as a learning enviorment, though I'm predicting right now that I'll be one of the slower people in the cohort. I like to take my time with things and really learn it well building a solid foundation for whatever comes next. On that note I'm probably one of the last people to be finishing up this blog post (9:51 pm Sunday, yikes!). From what I can tell, DBC looks for students who are passionate, humble, confident and acknowledge room for growth. These sound like fun awesome people to me and I can't wait to meet my cohort in person.

        Honestly my expectations of DBC haven't really changed all that much, I suspected it would be an experience that you control just as much as the DBC staff does. I remain very excited to experience the rest of the course, but I'm not going to lie, I'm equal parts nervous. This is my shot at having a career in something I really enjoy and I don't want to mess this up!
