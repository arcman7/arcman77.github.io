    <h1>Greatest Obstacle of the Tech Industry</h1>

      The tech industry right now faces a major problem which is stifling innovation and becoming a major burden and concern for most tech companies. The issue itself revolves around patents. Without patents inventors would not be fairly rewarded for their ambition and creativity. Many inventions take months to years of research before becoming a finalized product. The research and developement process usually consumes a lot of time and money. Inventing a new product can be a huge gamble and the inventors along with any investors rely on the fact that people will find their inventions to be useful and pay an appropriate price to make use of them. In this sense, patents serve to protect the intrest of inventors and provide motive to produce something that's never been made before. However, in it's current state, patents are actually slowing down inovation. The biggest cause of this is the existence of patent trolls. A patent troll is basically a litigation company that preys on other companies that aren't doing well, purchases any patents they can from said companies, and continuet to amass as many patents as they can. The problem with many patents is that they are generally very vague and often encompass ideas that are already in common use. Once the patent troll has possesion of such a patent, they will use it to threaten anyone they can feasibly argue is applying technology specified in the said patent. They are at the very least parasitic. They provide nothing to the economy, and at the sametime sap resources from companies that actually produce products for the market. This sort of predatory practice is of a huge concern to many companies.
