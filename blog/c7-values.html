    <h1>Values </h1>
    <h3>Week 7</h3>
    <h3> April 12th, 2015</h3>
    <br>

    <p id="header">
      When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I think back on my best experiences, I remember feelings of accomplishment, adventure, enthusiasm, or feeling like I was in control, had a high intellectual status, that I had a sense of creativity and feelings of being safe whenever I made money or had a sense of economic sercurity.
    </p>
    <p id="header">
      In general, I try to live up to these values: Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
    </p>
     <p>
        I agree very strongly that I try to live up to these values. They are reflected in my everyday life and almost anytime I feel good it involves at least one of those values. Often times even if I do things well it doesn't count much to me if I don't have at least two of the values I mentioned involved the achievement. In fact, it is those values that lead me to believe I've made any accomplishment at all.
     </p>
     <p>
       The strongest feeling that I had throughout my experiences also happened to be the most reocurring feeling in all of those memories as well. For, me this feeling is the sense of accomplishment. I need to feel as though I've done something worthwhile or something of value otherwise I don't feel as if I've done anything at all. I realized that each of the other feelings that I mentioned are all standards of measure that I use when evaluating the worth of something - how much intelligence did it take, were their unkown risks that made it an adventure without a predictable outcome, does it have monetary value.
     </p>
     <p id="header">
        What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?
     </p>
     <p>
      The last topic someone asked for my advice on could best be described as getting their act together. The person had a hard time following through with things and forming a stable schedule to live by. To be honest I don't think I'm the best person to be asking about in regards to those values because they certainly aren't the ones that I believe in the strongest. However, I've noticed that in college, quite a few of my friends would ask me for help in physics, and in those moments I would always feel proud. I suppose those feelings reinforced my persistence learning in the subject and thus increased the likelihood that I would be able to help people out in the future.

     <p id="header">
        How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it? Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?
     </p>
     <p>
       I'm not so sure if my values help or not with my sterotype feelings. I may be wrong, but at this point I feel like placing value in intellectual ablities and feeling bad about sports go almost hand in hand. I still think that the most important thing to think about whenever I feel those feelings of not measuring up to most people in atheletics is to remember that I am whoever I make myself to be. It has nothing to do with any group I may or may not belong to.
