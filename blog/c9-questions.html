      Analyze some of the questions you've asked (either in the community, to a a friend, or in Google). Were these good questions? What was good/ not so good about them? How could you make them better so you are more likely to get an answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      In my most recent questions I've found that I didn't articulate my thoughts clearly enough so that a person outside of my own head could follow it. Often times I find that I'll have to re-state the question at least once. The root of my problem is usually that I tend to leave out a lot of the details in my questions since I assume people will know what I'm talking about. To the person I'm talking to it may seem like I am asking a question without the necessary context.

      Whenever I'm using a website like stackoverflow I find it difficult to search for questions that might have the answers I'm looking for. I know for a fact that this is something I could work on a bit. I usually start off by typing certain keywords and phrases but somehow my queries never yield what I'm looking for. I think it's a matter of knowing the right buzz words to use in your search query. So often the thing or concept I'm searching for actually has a common name that I just don't know.

      What Makes A Good Question
    </p>
      A good question is insightful and it targets specific points that you don't understand about something in a given topic. It also leaves the answers open enough that you can ask follow up questions to learn more. I try not to ask about the basic mechanics of things because those usually allude to the fact that you're missing something conceptually and instead should be asking more conceptual questions. There are exceptions where it might be a valid question when asking for some obscure syntax but usually I try stay away from those sorts of questions that only have one answer.
