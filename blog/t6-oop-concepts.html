  <h2>Week 6: Difference Between Class Inheritance & Composition </h2>
  <h3>Skipper's log 4/5/2015:</h3>
  <p>
    In this post I'll cover the difference between implicit interactions between classes through a concept called called inheritance as well as the more explicit interactions done through something called class composition.
  </p>

  <p>
   Classes can inherit all of their methods and instance variables from another class by inheriting them from a parent class. This allows you share common features and functions between similar classes. This also saves you from inventing the wheel over and over again in each new class and to re-use code where applicable. In ruby this would look like this:
  </p>

  <div id="codeblock">
    <code> <pre> class Fish
  attr_reader :size, :color

  def initialize(size,color)
    @size = size
    @color = color
    @habitat = "water"
  end

  def swim
    p "Swimming at a moderate speed"
  end
end

class Trout < Fish
end

redtrout = Trout.new("12 inches",red")
redtrout.swim
=> "Swimming at a moderate speed"
redtrout.size
=> "12 inches"

  </code>
  </div>

  <p> As you can see, the class Trout was able to gain every method, attribute and instance variable that was defined in the class Fish. Now let's take it a step further:
  </p>

  <div id="codeblock">
      <code> <pre>
       class Trout < Fish
          def eat
            p "Eating a small bug, yum!"
          end
        end

        browntrout = Trout.new("13 inches, "brown")
        browntrout.eat
        => "Eating a small bug, yum!"

      </code>
  </div>

  <p>
    This is equivalent to:
  </p>
  <!--
  <div id="codeblock">
      <code> <pre>

      </code>
  </div>
  -->
  <div id="codeblock">
      <code> <pre>
        class Trout
          attr_reader :size, :color

          def initialize(size,color)
            @size = size
            @color = color
            @habitat = "water"
          end

          def swim
            p "Swimming at a moderate speed"
          end

          def eat
            p "Eating a small bug, yum!"
          end
        end

        browntrout = Trout.new("13 inches, "brown")
        browntrout.eat
        => "Eating a small bug, yum!"
      </code>
  </div>

  <p>
    The obvious advantage to using inheritance is that we don't have to define those methods again since we gain them through inheriting them from class Fish. We can then also re-open the class and add additional methods as needed. While this is all swell and dandy, this can lead to issues later own down the line. If you continue to inherit from later and later generation child classes, you will accumlate a lot of class baggage, and may end up with ridiculously complex class relationships. This can be particuarly troublesome when you have class variables as opposed to just instance variables being inherited. This means that whenever you inherit from a class with with a class variable, all of it's children classes will also have that very same class variable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing to know about class inheritance is that any given child class can only inherit from a single parent. There may be various classes that have useful methods that you want to include in your next class but you have to pick only one of them if you want to use inheritance. There is however a way around this, class composition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Class composition can be down in two ways. First, you can include an instance of a class you'd like to pull methods and variables from as an instance variable in the class you are defining. Second, you can use something called module mixing.
  </p>

  <div id="codeblock">
      <code> <pre>
        class FlyingFish
          def initialize(size,color)
            @fish = Fish.new(size,color)
          end

          def swim
            @fish.swim
          end

          def eat
            @fish.eat
          end
        end
      </code>
  </div>

  <p>
    Personally I find this last method quite amusing, since we are not inheriting from Fish nor are we using modules to mix anything in, this solution
