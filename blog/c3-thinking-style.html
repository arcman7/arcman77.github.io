    <p> According to Anthony Gregorc, there are four learning styles: <b>Concrete Sequential</b>, <b>Concrete Random</b>, <b>Abstract Sequential</b> and <b>Abstract Random</b>. After taking his <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> personality quiz </a> I scored 12, 44, 32, and 32 respectively, indicating that I have a strong preference towards the Concrete Random thinking style. Though at the same time I have similar preferences towards the other two, Abstract Sequentila and Abstract Random.

    <p id="header"> What has been the biggest struggle for you? </p>
    <p> The biggest struggle for me has been time management and not in the sense that I was expecting. Back in college I was really bad with procrastinating and would play way too many computer games than I should've allowed myself, but now I find myself spending far too much time perfecting small things, or just picking over details. It's a real struggle for me to only spend one hour for a blog post. Given any topic there's a lot to be said and choosing which bits I write about from a sea of information is really hard for me. I also find myself struggling to consolidate my thoughts. Communicating how I feel about certain topics is really hard for me since I rarely think about it, and almost never try to put my feelings into words. I can talk about technical concepts much easier and explain their usage but once I leave that area I find myself struggling to draw up my thoughts into words.
    </p>
    <p> I also read slowly. If I do read faster, then I don't feel as though I'm really absorbing the material or meaning of what I'm reading and end up re-reading the material. This causes me to spend more time while researching topics or just learning about coding, however I'm not sure this is something I can avoid.
    </p>
    <p id="header">Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else?<p>

    <p> Spending too much time on a topic for completeness and having trouble communicating my feelings are both definitely a part of the Abstract Sequential thinking type. However the slow reading I feel is something different, and I'm not exactly sure where I get that from.

    <p id="header"> Growth vs. Fixed Mindset </p>
    <p> When I read about Growth and Fixed mindsets I found myself thinking that I aligned completely with the growth mindset. However, after some introspection I realized that probably everybody wants to believe or think they are focused on growth and don't have pride that gets in the way of their learning and I think that to an extent I may have some or a few fixed mindset traits that I need to continually work on eliminating. I certainly feel adaptable and flexible when it comes to embracing new ways of thinking or doing things, and especially when it comes to cultures- where I grew up in Hawaii on the island of Oahu is called "The Mixing Pot" and it's very difficult to live otherwise. However, I know that I have room for improvement when it comes to certain things. For example when you look at my learning styles you'll notice that I have a particularly low Concrete Sequential score. I believe this is correlated to my general disorganization and trouble with consolidating my thoughts. I think the more well rounded you become the closer to becoming equal your preference style scores will be and I think that all learing styles are important to being ready for whatever challenges out there that are waiting for us. I suppose for now I need a bit more structure in my life.
