  <h2>Week 1: My adventures with Git & GitHub </h2>
  <h4>Skipper's log 3/1/2015:</h4>


    <p>
     Throughout this week I've read more than one article touting the importance of “version control,” and after reading through it all I now see that it really IS a big deal. Version control is like the cure-all for the inevitable entropy that follows whenever more than one person is working on something (or even one person if you are as sporadic as me). In short version control allows you to keep a saved-state copy of your files from any point in time you made changes to them. There are different options out there giving you a somewhat varied choice as to which version control system you use but so far my experience pertains only to Git. I must admit that I don't have much experience to speak from, but I'm pretty sure Git is one of the most awesome options out there, especially if a newbie like me can pick it up without much trouble in the span of four days. Git also has a few features that makes it different from the other version control options out there. From what I have read, Git doesn't just save a single file each time you make changes to it, but it also saves the state of all the other files that are associated with it. To put this into context, let's say you have four files; F1, F2, F3 and F4. Now let's say you make changes to F1 and F2, but not to F3 and F4. Git will save the state of the all the files at the same time you chose to save your changes of F1 and F2. This means you can revert to any previous state your project was in at any time you chose to save it. I can see this being especially important where perhaps a number of the files interact with each other to produce some desired result.

        After learning about Git and the commands to operate it with, I started to learn about GitHub and how it works hand in hand with Git. While I was reading about this I was initially confused about what the difference between Git and GitHub was. To me it seemed like they were basically the same thing until I came across this very useful analogy that helped me to see things clearly.  I want to share that here for anyone else that may find it helpful as well. Think of what a flash drive does and how it's limited; it can store lots of information and files while being small and compact, yet it is limited to sharing files with only the computer that it's plugged into. It has local access only. If you go to school or work and forget this flash drive there is no way for you to go online and log into your flash drive. On the other hand, if you use Dropbox you have access to the files from anywhere you can access the internet, so it is remotely accessible. However, if you have your laptop but can't get an internet connection then you are stuck. Git and GitHub together basically solve this problem. Git is like your flash drive, locally accessible, and GitHub is like your Dropbox, remotely accessible.
    </p>
        Git and GitHub do more than just provide local and remote access to your files.  The two serve as a way to share your files and later modifications you make with other people as well as having access to improvements and changes that other people might make as well. Say you started a project on making a nifty stock trading app and you post your source code on GitHub. By doing so you have created a repository or folder on GitHub where your files pertaining to that project are stored. If you chose to make this repository of your project files public someone else can download your remote repository onto their own local repository on their computer and start working on your project as well. This is called forking, where someone takes an original file and branches off to make their own version of it. The two of you could then start tackling different aspects of the project together and push the results from your individual computers to this shared repository on GitHub. To have Git and GitHub work like this for you, you need to continually save files on your own local repository using Git, and then push them to your remote repository on GitHub where it will be remotely accessible. Also at the same time if you chose to modify your files online via GitHub, you can then merge those changes back into your files on your local repository (on your machine) by pulling them from GitHub using Git.
